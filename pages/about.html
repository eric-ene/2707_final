		<h2>Who are we?</h2>
		<p>
			We are an independent bookstore located in South Windsor. Founded in 1993 by Eric Ene,
			we proudly serve our community by providing everyone with affordable books. From classic 
			literature to textbooks to manga, we have a book for everyone. Check in frequently, as new
			books are always being added!

			Disclaimer: New books are not, in fact, always being added. This is a website made for a 
			school project and not actually a real bookstore.
